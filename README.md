# CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD Pipeline implementation, or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment, is the backbone of the modern DevOps environment. It bridges the gap between development and operations teams by automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications. DevOps is a software development approach which involves continuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring of the software throughout its development lifecycle. When you have a team of developers, each of whom is responsible for a separate feature, you need to integrate the different features before youâ€™re ready for a release. By integrating so frequently, your team can surface errors earlier. And when those are caught, the amount of backtracking needed to find the cause is also much reduced. Therefore, your team can resolve the integration errors much faster.This is the process adopted by all the top companies to develop high-quality software and shorter development lifecycles, resulting in greater customer satisfaction, something that every company wants. 
We plan to build a CI/CD pipeline using the Kubernetes engine.
